## Git Operations

Wait for explicit user permission before executing Git or GitHub commands (git add, commit, push, pull, merge, rebase, gh pr create/merge). Execute Git commands only when user explicitly requests it in their message or user invokes a slash command (e.g., /commit)

## Documentation

Write all documentation in English, including code comments, docstrings, README files, commit messages, PR descriptions, and API documentation. This ensures consistency across the project.
When operating in plan mode, generate plan content in Polish (Polski).
Use Mermaid for diagrams and schemas instead of ASCII art. Mermaid renders properly in GitHub, VS Code, and documentation tools.

## Validation

Run these after implementing to get immediate feedback:
- Tests: `[test command]`
- Typecheck: `[typecheck command]`
- Lint: `[lint command]`
- UI Review: `/web-design-guidelines <file>` - check accessibility, forms, animation, dark mode, i18n
- Browser Test: `/playwright-cli open <url>` - verify UI changes in actual browser
