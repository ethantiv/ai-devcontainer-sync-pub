## Git Operations

Wait for explicit user permission before executing Git or GitHub commands (git add, commit, push, pull, merge, rebase, gh pr create/merge). Execute Git commands only when user explicitly requests it in their message or user invokes a slash command (e.g., /commit)

## Documentation

Write all documentation in English, including code comments, docstrings, README files, commit messages, PR descriptions, and API documentation. This ensures consistency across the project.
When operating in plan mode, generate plan content in Polish (Polski).
Use Mermaid for diagrams and schemas instead of ASCII art. Mermaid renders properly in GitHub, VS Code, and documentation tools.

## Simplicity and Focus

Make only the changes that are directly requested or clearly necessary:
- A bug fix stands on its own without cleaning up surrounding code
- A simple feature works without extra configurability
- Trust internal code and framework guarantees; validate only at system boundaries (user input, external APIs)
- Create helpers or abstractions only when they'll be reused
- The right amount of complexity is the minimum needed for the current task
- Reuse existing abstractions where possible and follow the DRY principle

## Tests and Validation

Run them after implementation to get immediate feedback:
- Tests: `[test command]`
- Typecheck: `[typecheck command]`
- Lint: `[lint command]`
- Browser Test: use skill `playwright-cli` to manually view and verify UI changes in actual browser

## Skills

Always load these skills at the start of relevant tasks:

| Skill | When to use |
|-------|--------------|
| `/frontend-design` | Building new UI components, pages, or applications |
| `/web-design-guidelines` | Reviewing UI for accessibility, forms, dark mode, i18n |
| `/vercel-react-best-practices` | Writing or optimizing React/Next.js code |
| `/playwright-cli` | Testing UI changes in actual browser |
