## Validation

- Tests: `[test command]`
- Typecheck: `[typecheck command]`
- Lint: `[lint command]`
- UI Review: `/web-design-guidelines <file>`
- Browser Test: `/playwright-cli open <url>`

## Operational Notes

Wait for explicit user permission before Git/GitHub commands. Execute only when user explicitly requests or invokes slash command (e.g., /commit).

Write documentation in English. Plan mode content in Polish. Use Mermaid for diagrams.

Make only changes directly requested. Bug fixes stand alone. Simple features work without extra configurability. Validate only at system boundaries. Create abstractions only when reused. Follow DRY principle.
