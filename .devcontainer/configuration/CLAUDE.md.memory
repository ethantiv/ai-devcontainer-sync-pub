## Git Operations

Wait for explicit user permission before executing Git or GitHub commands (git add, commit, push, pull, merge, rebase, gh pr create/merge). Execute Git commands only when:
- The user explicitly requests it in their message
- The user invokes a slash command (e.g., /commit)

After completing coding tasks, present a concise summary of changes and let the user decide when to commit. This allows them to review, test, and verify changes before committing.

## Simplicity and Focus

Make only the changes that are directly requested or clearly necessary:

- A bug fix stands on its own without cleaning up surrounding code
- A simple feature works without extra configurability
- Trust internal code and framework guarantees; validate only at system boundaries (user input, external APIs)
- Create helpers or abstractions only when they'll be reused
- The right amount of complexity is the minimum needed for the current task
- Reuse existing abstractions where possible and follow the DRY principle

When modifying code, remove unused code completely - delete deprecated versions, compatibility shims, and unused variables rather than commenting them out or renaming them.

## Code Quality and Security

Write general-purpose solutions using standard tools. Implement actual logic that solves the problem generally rather than hard-coding for specific test inputs. If a task is unreasonable or tests are incorrect, inform the user rather than working around them.

Be aware of security vulnerabilities such as command injection, XSS, SQL injection, and other OWASP top 10 issues. Fix insecure code when you notice it.

## Tool Usage

When calling multiple tools with no dependencies between them, make all independent calls in parallel. For example, read 3 files simultaneously rather than sequentially. This increases speed and efficiency. When calls depend on previous results, call them sequentially without guessing missing parameters.

Use absolute paths in generated projects and configuration files because relative paths break across sessions and different working directories.

Clean up any temporary files, scripts, or helpers you create for iteration or testing at the end of the task.

## UI Testing

For UI changes, verify fixes using the actual UI before claiming they work. Test the actual user flow rather than relying solely on code analysis or unit tests.
Use agent-browser CLI for browser automation.

## Documentation

Write all documentation in English, including code comments, docstrings, README files, commit messages, PR descriptions, and API documentation. This ensures consistency across the international team.

When operating in plan mode, generate plan content in Polish (Polski) - task descriptions, implementation steps, architecture decisions, and questions for clarification.

Use Mermaid for diagrams and schemas instead of ASCII art. Mermaid renders properly in GitHub, VS Code, and documentation tools.

When making significant changes to the codebase (new features, configuration changes, architecture modifications), update relevant documentation files (README.md, CLAUDE.md) as part of the same task.

## Communication

Provide direct, fact-based progress reports. Be conversational and natural without unnecessary verbosity, skip detailed summaries.

## Frontend Skills

When working on frontend/UI tasks, load relevant skills at the start before writing UI code:
- `web-design-guidelines` - For any frontend/UI work (accessibility, forms, animation, dark mode, i18n)
- `frontend-design` - For any frontend/UI work (distinctive, production-grade interfaces)
- `vercel-react-best-practices` - Additionally for React/Next.js projects (waterfalls, bundle size, re-renders, SSR)
