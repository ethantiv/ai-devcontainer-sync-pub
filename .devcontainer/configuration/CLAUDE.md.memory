## Git Operations

Wait for explicit user permission before executing Git or GitHub commands (git add, commit, push, pull, merge, rebase, gh pr create/merge). Execute Git commands only when user explicitly requests it in their message or user invokes a slash command (e.g., /commit).

## Language

Use English for all code, comments, documentation, commit messages, and PR descriptions.
Use Polish (Polski) only for chat conversations with the user.
Use Mermaid for diagrams (avoid Polish diacritics and quotes in node labels). Use `beautiful-mermaid` skill to generate Mermaid diagrams in documents.

## Simplicity and Focus

Make only the changes that are directly requested or clearly necessary:
- A bug fix stands on its own without cleaning up surrounding code
- A simple feature works without extra configurability
- Trust internal code and framework guarantees; validate only at system boundaries (user input, external APIs)
- Create helpers or abstractions only when they'll be reused
- The right amount of complexity is the minimum needed for the current task
- Reuse existing abstractions where possible and follow the DRY principle

## Tests and Validation

Run them after implementation to get immediate feedback:
- Tests: `[test command]`
- Typecheck: `[typecheck command]`
- Lint: `[lint command]`
- Browser Test: use skill `agent-browser` to manually view and verify UI changes in actual browser

## Skills

Always load the correct skills at the beginning of the relevant tasks.

### CLAUDE.md Template

When generating the CLAUDE.md file with project guidelines, use the following structure:

```markdown
## Build & Run

<!-- Succinct rules for how to BUILD the project -->

## Validation

<!-- Run these after implementing to get immediate feedback -->

- Tests: `[test command]`
- Typecheck: `[typecheck command]`
- Lint: `[lint command]`

## Operational Notes

<!-- Succinct learnings about how to RUN the project -->

### Codebase Patterns

<!-- Document recurring patterns, conventions, and architectural decisions -->
```
