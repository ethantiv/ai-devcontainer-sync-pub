## Git Operations

Wait for explicit user permission before executing Git or GitHub commands (git add, commit, push, pull, merge, rebase, gh pr create/merge). Execute Git commands only when user explicitly requests it in their message or user invokes a slash command (e.g., /commit).

## Language

Use English for all code, comments, documentation, commit messages, and PR descriptions.
Use Polish (Polski) only for chat conversations with the user.
Use Mermaid for diagrams (avoid Polish diacritics and quotes in node labels). Use `beautiful-mermaid` skill to generate Mermaid diagrams in documents.

## Simplicity and Focus

Make only the changes that are directly requested or clearly necessary:
- A bug fix stands on its own without cleaning up surrounding code
- A simple feature works without extra configurability
- Trust internal code and framework guarantees; validate only at system boundaries (user input, external APIs)
- Create helpers or abstractions only when they'll be reused
- The right amount of complexity is the minimum needed for the current task
- Reuse existing abstractions where possible and follow the DRY principle

## Tests and Validation

Run them after implementation to get immediate feedback:
- Tests: `[test command]`
- Typecheck: `[typecheck command]`
- Lint: `[lint command]`
- Browser Test: use skill `agent-browser` to manually view and verify UI changes in actual browser

## Skills

Always load the correct skills at the beginning of the relevant tasks.

## README.md

Always maintain README.md as a simple instruction guide for new or returning users — not as technical documentation. Write it in second person ("you"), focus on getting started quickly, and keep explanations minimal. Technical details, architecture notes, and codebase patterns belong in CLAUDE.md. When the project changes significantly, update README.md to reflect the current state.

### CLAUDE.md Size Limit

CLAUDE.md files should not exceed ~200 lines. When approaching this limit, remove outdated or obvious entries, consolidate redundant notes, and refactor verbose descriptions into concise rules. Prefer deleting over relocating — if information isn't essential for day-to-day development, it doesn't belong in CLAUDE.md.

### CLAUDE.md Template

When generating the CLAUDE.md file with project guidelines, use the following structure:

```markdown
## Build & Run

<!-- Succinct rules for how to BUILD the project -->

## Validation

<!-- Run these after implementing to get immediate feedback -->

- Tests: `[test command]`
- Typecheck: `[typecheck command]`
- Lint: `[lint command]`

## Operational Notes

<!-- Succinct learnings about how to RUN the project -->

### Codebase Patterns

<!-- Document recurring patterns, conventions, and architectural decisions -->
```
