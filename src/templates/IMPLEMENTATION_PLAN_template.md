## Goal

<!-- Describe the main objective of this task -->

## Current Phase

<!-- Update as you progress: Phase 1, Phase 2, etc. -->

## Phases

<!--
Each phase = one build iteration. Keep phases small:
- 2-3 tasks per phase (MAX). If a phase has more, split it.
- Each task = one concrete, verifiable change (file/function/test).
- Small project: 2-5 phases. Medium: 5-15. Large: 15+.
- Name phases by deliverable, not category
  (e.g., "Add user model + migration" not "Backend").

Phase format:
